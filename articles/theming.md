# Theming your shiny

Theming in `OmopViewer` shiny apps is done using
[brand.yml](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/), that will rely on a
`_brand.yml` file written in the root of your shiny project. That
`_brand.yml` file customises your shiny app colour and also the tables
and plots created using
[visOmopresults](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/). The
package has some predefined themes, some come from the `visOmopResults`
package and some others defined here in `OmopViewer`.
